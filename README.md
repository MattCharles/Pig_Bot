Pig_Bot
=======

Simple Reddit bot that translates comments into Pig Latin.

Changelog
=========
v0.1 Initial commit. Bot handles words that begin with vowels differently than those that begin with consonants. For example, the comment 'Reddit is cool' will be translated as 'edditRay isay oolcay'.

Planned Features
================
Punctuation handling. 'Reddit.' will translate to 'edditRay.', not 'eddit.Ray'
