Pig_Bot
=======

Simple Reddit bot that translates comments into Pig Latin.

Changelog
=========
v0.1 Initial commit. Bot handles words that begin with vowels differently than those that begin with consonants. For example, the comment 'Reddit is cool' will be translated as 'edditRay isay oolcay'.
v0.2 Fixed several glaring issues with the bot, such as duplication of comment strings. Also added punctuation handling.

Planned Features
================
Permanently store already_done variable so we don't spam old comments!
